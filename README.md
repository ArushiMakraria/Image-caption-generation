Date: May 23rd, 2024

## Project Overview

This project aims to enhance accessibility for visually impaired individuals by enabling them to interact with visual content more effectively. Our image captioning model automatically generates text-based captions for images, creating a user-friendly solution that improves the inclusivity and usability of digital content.

## Dataset

The Flickr 8k dataset contains 8,000 images, each paired with five captions. This dataset is widely used for training and evaluating image captioning models due to its diverse range of images and captions, making it an excellent benchmark for developing models that generalize well across different scenes and contexts.

## Model Architectures
### Model 1: LSTM + CNN
### Model 2: LSTM + ResNet 50
